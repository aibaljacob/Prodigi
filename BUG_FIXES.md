# Bug Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed (October 19, 2025)

### 1. ✅ **Fixed: `Call to undefined method User::getUserById()`**

**Problem**: The `getUserById()` method was missing from the User class, causing errors in checkout.php and profile.php.

**Solution**: Added the `getUserById()` method to `classes/User.php`:
```php
public function getUserById($userId) {
    $query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = :user_id";
    return $this->db->fetchOne($query, ['user_id' => $userId]);
}
```

**Files Modified**:
- `classes/User.php` - Added getUserById() method

### 2. ✅ **Fixed: Product Thumbnails Not Showing**

**Problem**: Database stored full paths like `uploads/products/filename.png`, but the code was adding `/uploads/products/` again, resulting in double paths like `/uploads/products/uploads/products/filename.png`.

**Solution**: 
- Updated database to store only filenames (e.g., `68f4c4a4e2a19_1760871588.png`)
- Code now correctly constructs full path: `APP_URL . '/uploads/products/' . $filename`

**Database Updates**:
```sql
-- Fixed thumbnail paths
UPDATE products 
SET thumbnail_image = REPLACE(thumbnail_image, 'uploads/products/', '') 
WHERE thumbnail_image LIKE 'uploads/products/%';

-- Fixed product file paths
UPDATE products 
SET product_file_path = REPLACE(product_file_path, 'uploads/files/', '') 
WHERE product_file_path LIKE 'uploads/files/%';
```

**Result**: Thumbnails now display correctly on all pages:
- Home page (featured products)
- Products listing page
- Product detail page
- Cart page
- Profile page (purchase history)
- Payment success page

### 3. ✅ **Fixed: Product Cards Not Clickable**

**Problem**: Users had to click specifically on the product title text to open product details. Clicking anywhere else on the card did nothing.

**Solution**: Made entire product card clickable while preventing event bubbling on action buttons.

**Files Modified**:
1. **views/home.php**:
   - Added `onclick="window.location.href='product.php?slug=...'"` to `.product-card`
   - Added `style="cursor: pointer;"` for visual feedback
   - Added `event.stopPropagation()` to cart button to prevent card click

2. **products.php**:
   - Added `onclick="window.location.href='product.php?slug=...'"` to `.product-card`
   - Added `style="cursor: pointer;"` for visual feedback
   - Added `event.stopPropagation()` to cart button and login link

**Before**:
```html
<div class="product-card">
    <img src="...">
    <h3><a href="product.php?slug=...">Product Name</a></h3>
    <button onclick="addToCart(...)">Add to Cart</button>
</div>
```

**After**:
```html
<div class="product-card" onclick="window.location.href='product.php?slug=...'" style="cursor: pointer;">
    <img src="...">
    <h3><a href="product.php?slug=...">Product Name</a></h3>
    <button onclick="event.stopPropagation(); addToCart(...)">Add to Cart</button>
</div>
```

**User Experience Improvement**:
- Click anywhere on card to view product details
- Hover shows pointer cursor indicating clickability
- Cart button still works independently without navigating away
- More intuitive and mobile-friendly
