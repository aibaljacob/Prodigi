# Auth Pages - Fixed Side-by-Side Layout Issue

## Problem
Labels and input fields were displaying side-by-side instead of stacked vertically, causing a broken layout where:
- "Username or Email" label appeared next to the input field
- "Password" label appeared next to its input field
- Elements were not properly aligned

## Root Cause
CSS specificity conflict between:
1. `dark-neon-theme.css` - Base theme styles
2. `auth-dark.css` - Auth-specific styles

The auth-dark.css selectors weren't specific enough to override the base theme, causing layout issues.

## Solution
Added more specific CSS selectors with `.auth-form` and `.auth-box` prefixes to ensure proper cascade and override:

### Changes Made to `assets/css/auth-dark.css`

#### 1. Form Container & Groups
```css
/* Before */
.form-group { }
.form-group label { }

/* After */
.auth-form .form-group { display: block; width: 100%; }
.auth-form .form-group label { display: block !important; width: 100%; }
```

#### 2. Form Inputs
```css
/* More specific selectors */
.auth-form .form-group input { display: block !important; width: 100%; }
.auth-form .form-group select { display: block !important; width: 100%; }
.auth-form .form-group textarea { display: block !important; width: 100%; }
```

#### 3. Inline Elements (Checkbox + Link)
```css
.auth-form .form-group-inline { display: flex !important; width: 100%; }
.auth-form .checkbox-label { display: flex !important; }
.auth-form .link-text { flex-shrink: 0; }
```

#### 4. Buttons
```css
.auth-form .btn-block { display: block !important; width: 100%; }
.auth-form button.btn-block { display: block !important; width: 100%; }
```

#### 5. Other Elements
- `.auth-box .auth-divider` - Full width divider
- `.auth-box .auth-footer` - Full width footer
- `.auth-box .alert` - Full width alerts
- `.auth-box .demo-credentials` - Full width demo box

### Key Improvements
✅ **Added `!important`** on critical display properties to override base theme
✅ **Increased specificity** with `.auth-form` and `.auth-box` prefixes
✅ **Added `width: 100%`** to all block-level elements
✅ **Added `display: block !important`** to labels and inputs
✅ **Added `flex-shrink: 0`** to prevent element compression

## Result
✅ Labels now appear **above** input fields (stacked vertically)
✅ Input fields span full width of container
✅ Proper spacing between form elements
✅ Checkbox and "Forgot Password" link properly aligned horizontally
✅ Button spans full width
✅ All elements properly contained within auth-box

## Testing
Verified on:
- ✅ Login page (`/login.php`)
- ✅ Registration page (`/register.php`)
- ✅ Desktop view
- ✅ Mobile responsive view
